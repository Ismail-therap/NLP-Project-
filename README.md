# NLP-Project: Fall 2021
The projects are part of the graduate-level course CSE-464 : Soft Computing [Fall 2021 @ NMT] Course Instructor : Dr. Hamdy Soliman

## Goal:

In this project the objective was to find the best performing model among Fasttext, LSTM and BERT in predicting the public opinion in terms of stars.

## Findings:

We didn't found any winner among them. All performing pretty similar. So, use different data set or even try different models to compare. We had used Yelp customer reviews as a training data.
